        <h2>Creative Research Isn't Enough.</h2>
        <p>
          You know the frustration: You pour your budget into an ad, but Facebook "doesn't love it" – your CPMs go through the roof.
        </p>
        <p>
          Your CPA is so high you can't even break even, let alone see a profit. All that time and money on "creative testing" feels like a massive, expensive gamble.
        </p>
        <p>
          The truth is, what works in one market often flops in another. Your gut feeling isn't enough. You need data from your market.

        <h2>An AI Trained on the African Market.</h2>
        <p>
          Forget generic, global AI tools. KreativeOracle is different. We are training our AI on millions of successful and failed ads that actually ran in Nigeria and across Africa. This means our predictions are built on:
        </p>
        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li>
            <strong>Culturally relevant data:</strong> It understands our unique humor, values, and what makes us click.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Real performance metrics:</strong> It knows the difference between an ad that looks good and one that actually sells to an African audience.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          We know what makes the African buyer say "I want this," not from guesswork, but from intense, local data that doesn't lie.
